Computer network  refers to interconnected computing devices that can exchange data between nodes over a shared medium. 

There are 3 main types of computer network that are classified by their geographical coverage, communication, data transfer speed and size-
1. LAN 
2. MAN 
3. WAN 

Network Topologies-
1.Star - Each node is connected to a central hub
2. Ring - All other nodes are connected to each other forming by a Ring (first node is connected to last one)
3. Mesh - Each node in mesh network connects to every other node
4. Bus - Every device in a bus network connects to a single cable called bus
5. Tree - It is a hybrid network topology

OSI model-
There are 7 layers-
1. Physical layer  -> convert data into bits
2. Data link layer  -> convert bit into frame 
3. Network layer  -> convert frame into packets
4. Transport layer  -> convert packet into segments
5. seesion layer  -> responsible for dialog control and synchronization
6. presentation layer -> responsible for translation, encryption and compression
7. Application layer -> user directly interact with data
