A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices (such as computers, servers, smartphones, and other hardware) that communicate with each other to share resources, information, and services. 

Types of Networks:

Local Area Network (LAN): A network confined to a small geographic area.
Wide Area Network (WAN): A network that covers a broad area.


Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): Covers a larger area than a LAN but smaller than a WAN.

Personal Area Network (PAN): A small network, often used for connecting devices like smartphones and laptops within a very short range.

Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN): Similar to LAN but uses wireless connections.

Protocol: A set of rules and conventions for communication between network devices. 

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure)

FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

IP Address: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a network.

IPv4: Uses a 32-bit address scheme allowing for over 4 billion unique addresses.

IPv6: Uses a 128-bit address scheme, vastly expanding the number of possible addresses.
